# kakimail

A simple and portable SMTP server, written in pure Rust (:rocket::rocket::rocket:). Anyone can self-host this server and use it as their own.

## Features:

- None yet...

## TO-DO:

- [ ] SMTP state machine that handles incoming requests (as per [edgemail](https://github.com/psarna/edgemail/tree/master))
- [ ] Ability to send messages (unlike edgemail)

### Not going to be implemented:
- User auth (this is a personal project, meant to be used just by one person)
- idk?? i'm just going to keep it simple

### Notes
This is just the server. I plan on making clients for desktop (gui, tui) and web.
